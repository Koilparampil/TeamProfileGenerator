## Description 
The motivation for this project was to build a Node.JS command line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering Team and then generates an HTML webpage that summarizes the injformation that was taken in. The code does not have a specific problem it solves, however it makes it easy for a manager to have quick acess to some basic information about their team. Throughout making this project I had learned how to use Inquirer in a deeper way as well as learning to use the Jest package to run tests on the code. I also learend how to effectively use classes to simplify the code I was writing.

## Installation
For this Project you had to install two NPM packages, Inquirer and Jest, and you also had to already have Node.JS installed. Too install Inquirer and Jest all you have to do is call `npm i jest` and `npm i inquirer` these commanda have to be runn in the terminal at the file location in which you are running the application. 
## Usage
Using this software is simple. After installing the required dependencies, all you have to do is run `node .\index.js` in the file directory that the code lives in. The Code will guide you in doing the rest. All you have to do is answer the questions that the code will ask you. To exit the code and write the file, you just have to choose the `I don't want to add any more team members` choice when prompted. This will end the code and create your HTML in the ./dist folder.
## Collaborators

I have to thank the creators of the Jest and Inquirer packages, for whom without, I would not be able to have completed this project in such an efficient manner. I would like to also thank W3Schools for their tutorials on switch statements, it helped me a lot. MDN also deserves recognition for all their documentation on Javascript.

## Tests
There are 4 tests in this project, one for each of the classes that I had used. The tests essentially confirm the functionality of the classes. It makes sure the mathods inside of the classes work and that you can get the proper data output from their variables. You can run this test by goiung into the root folder of the code and running `npm run tests`. This will run all 4 tests together, they should all pass.
